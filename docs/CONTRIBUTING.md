## Quick Start by Contributor Type

### Internal Contributors (Caylent Employees)
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/caylent-solutions/terraform-modules.git
cd terraform-modules
make install-tools && make configure

# 2. Create module
git checkout -b feature/my-module
cp -r skeletons/generic-skeleton providers/aws/primitives/my-module
# ... implement your module ...

# 3. Validate and test
make module-validate MODULE_PATH=providers/aws/primitives/my-module MODULE_TYPE=primitive
cd providers/aws/primitives/my-module && make test

# 4. Submit PR
git add . && git commit -m "feat: add my-module primitive"
git push origin feature/my-module
# Create PR via GitHub UI
```

### External Contributors
```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
# Fork via GitHub UI first
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/terraform-modules.git
cd terraform-modules
make install-tools && make configure

# 2. Create module

## Complete SDLC Flow

### 1. Development Phase
- Follow [module structure requirements](terraform-module-structure.md)
- Implement comprehensive tests using [Terraform Terratest Framework](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/terraform-terratest-framework)
- Use conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- Validate locally before submitting

### 2. Pull Request Submission
- **PR Detection**: System detects Terraform module vs non-Terraform changes
- **Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis starts immediately (parallel to validation)
- **Validation**: Comprehensive policy and quality checks

### 3. Testing Phase
- **Internal Contributors**: Tests execute automatically after validation
- **External Contributors**: Tests require manual approval from Caylent maintainer for security

### 4. Review and Approval
- Slack notifications sent to code owners
- Code owners review and must explicitly approve before merge

### 5. Merge Process
- System automatically merges PR after approval (squash merge)
- Feature branch deleted automatically

### 6. Post-Merge Validation
- All validation checks re-run on merged code
- Additional security scanning on main branch

### 7. Release Preparation
- Manual QA certification required from code owners
- Authorizes semantic version release

### 8. Automated Release
- **Terraform Modules**: Individual semantic versioning per module
- **Non-Terraform**: Repository-wide semantic versioning
- Automatic changelog generation and GitHub release creation

## CI/CD Workflows Overview

This repository uses a multi-stage, automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, security, and compliance for all contributions. The workflows support both production and dry run (safe testing) modes.

### Main Workflows
- **PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)**: Entry point for all pull requests. Detects contributor type (internal/external), enforces workflow file protection, and routes PRs to the correct validation workflow based on whether Terraform modules or non-Terraform code are changed.
- **Main Validation (`main-validation.yml`)**: Core workflow for PR approval, merge decisions, and release orchestration. Handles both Terraform and non-Terraform changes, supports dry run mode, and manages merge approval routing.
- **Release (`release.yml`)**: Handles both Terraform and non-Terraform releases. Uses custom logic for module versioning and `python-semantic-release` for non-Terraform code. Automates changelog generation and tagging.
- **CodeQL Analysis (`codeql-analysis.yml`)**: Runs automated security scanning on all pushes and PRs.
- **Weekly Module Health Check (`weekly-module-health-check.yml`)**: Runs comprehensive tests on all Terraform modules weekly and on demand.

### Security Features
- **Workflow File Protection**: External contributors cannot modify workflow files. Internal contributors must follow the SDLC process for workflow changes.
- **Automated Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis runs on all PRs and pushes.
- **Manual Approval Gates**: Maintainers must approve PRs and test execution for external contributors.
- **Environment Isolation**: Tests for external contributors run in protected environments.
- **Action Allowlist**: Only SHA-pinned, pre-approved GitHub Actions are permitted.

### Pull Request Flow
1. **Security Check**: Validates contributor type and workflow file changes.
2. **Change Detection**: Determines if the PR changes a Terraform module or only non-module files.
3. **Validation**: Runs comprehensive policy, linting, formatting, documentation, and security checks.
4. **Testing**: Executes full test suite (automatic for internal, manual approval for external contributors).
5. **Approval & Merge**: Maintainers review and approve. PRs are auto-merged after approval.
6. **Release**: Automated versioning and changelog for both Terraform and non-Terraform code.

## Terraform and Module Strategy

This monorepo manages all stateful resources (cloud, SaaS, Kubernetes, etc.) using a strict Terraform module strategy:

- **Module Types:**
  - **Primitive Modules:** Manage a single resource type. Must be agnostic, use official providers, and follow the latest skeleton and repo policies.
  - **Utility Modules:** Add opinionated functionality (e.g., naming/tagging). No resource blocks. Must be agnostic and live in this monorepo.
  - **Reference Modules:** Collections of primitives/utilities providing a reference architecture or service. Must be agnostic and tested for integration.
  - **Client Wrapper Modules:** Client-specific wrappers that import reference modules and add custom logic. Must live in the clientâ€™s repo and follow the same structure/testing standards.

- **General Requirements:**
  - All modules must use the latest skeleton, pass all OPA policies, and be fully tested (rego and Terratest).
  - All modules must be semantically versioned and released via CI/CD.
  - Use Apache 2.0 license unless client-specific.

- **Provider Strategy:**
  - Always use the latest stable official provider.
  - If a required feature/bugfix is missing, fork the provider, follow best practices for forking, and upstream changes when possible. See below for the provider forking workflow.

- **Terragrunt Usage:**
  - Terragrunt may be used in downstream consumer repos for orchestration, but all Terraform logic must reside in this monorepo.

- **Self-Contained and Single Purpose:**
  - Every module must be self-contained and focused on a single responsibility, supporting the [Self-Contained Repository Deployment Principle](principles/self-contained-repository-deployment-principle.md) and [Single Purpose Repository Principle](principles/single-purpose-repository-principle.md).

## Provider Forking Workflow

If you must fork a provider:
1. Fork the latest provider and add your feature/bugfix.
2. Ensure full testing and no regressions.
3. Use the fork in your module and deliver to production.
4. Create a tech debt story to upstream your change.
5. Refactor to use the official provider once merged.
6. If frequent changes are needed, manage your fork with a full pipeline and regular merges from upstream.

## Module Types and Structure

This repository contains different types of Terraform modules:
- **Primitives**: Basic building blocks that manage a single AWS resource
- **Collections**: Combinations of primitives that solve common use cases
- **References**: Reference implementations for specific scenarios
- **Utilities**: Helper modules for common tasks
- **Skeletons**: Template modules for creating new modules

All modules must follow the [required structure](terraform-module-structure.md) and [policies](terraform-module-policies.md).

---

## Development Guidelines
- No hard-coded values in Terraform code
- Variables must be declared in variables.tf
- Outputs must be declared in outputs.tf
- Provider configurations must be in versions.tf
- Local variables must be in locals.tf
- Write tests for all examples using the [Terraform Terratest Framework](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/terraform-terratest-framework)
- Ensure tests validate the module's core functionality
- Include common tests for validation, formatting, and outputs
- Create example-specific tests for unique features
- Follow the [test structure requirements](terraform-module-testing.md)
- Configure test behavior using the `test.config` file in the module root
- Control idempotency testing with `TERRATEST_IDEMPOTENCY=true|false` in the config file
- All Go test files must pass linting (`make go-lint`)
- All Go test files must be properly formatted (`make go-format`)
