# Single Purpose Repository Principle

## Principle Overview
This principle advocates for a poly-repository (poly-repo) strategy where each module or service is dedicated to producing a single, environment-agnostic artifact that serves a specific purpose. In the context of this monorepo, each module must be capable of undergoing the complete software development lifecycle—from development through to building, testing, deployment, and feature release—in isolation.

Key aspects of this principle include:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module should focus on a single functionality or service, aligning with the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) by Robert C. Martin. This applies to all module types, including primitives, collections, references, and utilities.
- **Environment Agnosticism**: The artifact produced by each module should be operable in any environment, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
- **Independent Lifecycle Management**: Each module should independently manage its development, build, test, deployment, and feature release processes.
- **Isolation**: Changes in one module should not directly affect or require changes in other modules, promoting modular development and easier maintenance.
- **Autonomy**: Each module operates autonomously, allowing for faster iterations and more focused development efforts.

## Implementation
In practice, this principle supports the development of diverse module types managed in individual directories. This facilitates independent scaling, easier updates, and quicker adaptation to changes, aligning with agile and DevOps methodologies.

## Benefits
- Facilitates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes.
- Enhances scalability and maintainability of the codebase.
- Encourages focused and efficient development practices.

This principle is particularly effective in large-scale infrastructure projects where multiple teams work on different modules, ensuring coherence and consistency in development practices across the organization.

> **Note:** Support for "mono repos of poly repos"—where nested poly repos are managed under a unified monorepo while still aligning with these principles—is planned for the future. All nested repos will be required to adhere to the same self-contained and single-purpose strategies described here.
