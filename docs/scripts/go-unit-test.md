# Go Unit Test Script

This document describes the Go unit test script used for running tests and collecting coverage metrics for Go code in the monorepo.

## Overview

The `go-unit-test` script is a centralized tool for running Go unit tests across all Go packages in the monorepo. It provides consistent test execution, coverage reporting, and error handling.

## Features

- Run unit tests for all Go packages defined in the monorepo configuration
- Collect and report test coverage metrics
- Generate coverage reports in both text and JSON formats
- Properly handle and report test failures
- Support for running tests without collecting coverage
- CI enforcement of minimum 20% test coverage threshold

## Usage

The script is primarily used through the following make tasks:

```bash
# Run all Go unit tests without coverage
make go-unit-test

# Run all Go unit tests with coverage and output as text
make go-unit-test-coverage

# Run all Go unit tests with coverage and output as JSON
make go-unit-test-coverage-json
```

## Command Line Options

The script supports the following command line options:

- `--no-coverage`: Run tests without collecting coverage data
- `--coverage-text`: Output coverage as formatted text
- `--coverage-json`: Output coverage as JSON

## Configuration

The script uses the `coverage_groups` section in the `monorepo-config.json` file to determine which packages to test:

```json
"coverage_groups": [
  {
    "name": "Go Unit Test",
    "emoji": "üß™",
    "outputFile": "go-unit-test.out",
    "testPath": "./scripts/go-unit-test",
    "coverPkg": "./scripts/go-unit-test"
  },
  {
    "name": "Detect Module Changes",
    "emoji": "üîç",
    "outputFile": "detect-module-changes.out",
    "testPath": "./scripts/detect-module-changes",
    "coverPkg": "./scripts/detect-module-changes"
  }
]
```

Each entry in the `coverage_groups` array defines:

- `name`: Display name for the test group
- `emoji`: Emoji to display in console output
- `outputFile`: Name of the coverage output file
- `testPath`: Path to the directory containing the tests
- `coverPkg`: Package path for coverage collection

## Output Format

### Text Output

When run with the `--coverage-text` flag, the script produces a human-readable report:

### JSON Output

When run with the `--coverage-json` flag, the script produces a machine-readable JSON report:

```json
{
  "modules": [
    {
      "name": "Go Unit Test",
      "coverage": 15.3,
      "statements": 73
    },
    {
      "name": "Detect Module Changes",
      "coverage": 52,
      "statements": 47
    }
  ],
  "total": 23.121921182266007,
  "errors": 0
}
```

## Error Handling

The script properly handles and reports test failures:

- Test failures are reported in the console output
- Failed tests are marked with a ‚ùå emoji
- The script exits with a non-zero status code if any tests fail
- In JSON output, errors are included in the `errors` field and individual module results

## Coverage Threshold

The CI pipeline enforces a minimum test coverage threshold of 20% for all Go code:

- The `non-terraform-validation.yml` workflow includes a step that checks if the total coverage is at least 20%
- If coverage is below the threshold, the workflow will fail with a clear error message
- Coverage percentage is extracted from the JSON output of `make go-unit-test-coverage-json`
- The threshold check displays a green "PASS" message when coverage meets or exceeds 20%
- The threshold check displays a red "FAIL" message when coverage is below 20%

## Implementation Details

The script is implemented in Go and follows these steps:

1. Parse command line flags and arguments
2. Load the monorepo configuration file
3. For each coverage group:
   - Run the tests with or without coverage
   - Collect and parse the coverage data
   - Report any errors
4. Calculate the weighted average coverage
5. Output the results in the requested format
6. Exit with the appropriate status code

## Adding New Test Groups

To add a new test group:

1. Add a new entry to the `coverage_groups` section in `monorepo-config.json`
2. Ensure the directory structure matches the expected pattern
3. Run the tests to verify they are picked up correctly
