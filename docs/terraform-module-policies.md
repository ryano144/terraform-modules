This document outlines the policies enforced for all Terraform modules in this repository.

## Module Structure Policies

### File Organization

1. **Variable Declarations**
   - All variable declarations must be in `variables.tf`
   - No variable declarations are allowed in other files

2. **Output Declarations**
   - All output declarations must be in `outputs.tf`
   - No output declarations are allowed in other files

3. **Terraform and Provider Configuration**
   - All `terraform` blocks must be in `versions.tf`
   - All `required_providers` blocks must be in `versions.tf`
   - No terraform or provider configuration is allowed in other files

4. **Local Variables**
   - All `locals` blocks must be in `locals.tf`
   - No locals blocks are allowed in other files

### Required Files and Directories

1. **Root Directory Files**
   - `main.tf` (required, non-empty)
   - `variables.tf` (required, non-empty)
   - `outputs.tf` (required, can be empty)
   - `versions.tf` (required, non-empty)
   - `locals.tf` (required, can be empty)
   - `README.md` (required, non-empty)
   - `TERRAFORM-DOCS.md` (required, non-empty)
   - `CODEOWNERS` (required, non-empty)
   - `Makefile` (required, must match skeleton)
   - `test.config` (required, must include TERRATEST_IDEMPOTENCY setting)

2. **Examples Directory**
   - At least one example directory is required
   - Each example must contain:
     - `main.tf` (non-empty)
     - `variables.tf` (non-empty)
     - `versions.tf` (non-empty)
     - `terraform.tfvars` (non-empty)
     - `README.md` (non-empty)
     - `TERRAFORM-DOCS.md` (non-empty)

3. **Tests Directory**
   - For each example directory, there must be a corresponding test directory with the same name
   - If there are multiple examples, a `common` test directory is also required
   - Each test directory must contain:
     - `module_test.go` (non-empty)
     - `README.md` (non-empty)
   - The tests directory must have a `README.md` (non-empty)
   - Optional `helpers` directory, if present must contain:
     - `helpers.go` (non-empty)
     - `README.md` (non-empty)

### Code Quality Policies

1. **No Hard-coded Values**
   - All values in Terraform code must use variables
   - No hard-coded strings, numbers, booleans, JSON objects, or YAML heredocs
   - Hard-coded values are only permitted in:
     - `terraform.tfvars` files
     - Default values in `variables.tf`
   - Hard-coded values are not allowed in any other files or blocks

2. **No Nested Modules**
   - Terraform modules cannot contain nested modules
   - All `.tf` files must be in the root directory (except in examples and tests)

3. **Limited .tf Files**
   - Only `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `versions.tf`, and `locals.tf` are allowed in the root directory

4. **Resource Naming**
   - Resource names cannot be dynamically generated
   - Resource names must come from variables or variable defaults
   - No interpolation or functions are allowed in resource names

5. **Module Sources**
   - No local module sources are allowed (no relative or absolute paths)
   - All module sources must have version constraints
   - External module sources (non-Caylent) must use pinned version constraints (exact version)
   - Caylent module sources may use fuzzy version constraints for minor and patch updates

### Testing Policies

1. **Required Test Structure**
   - Each example must have a corresponding test directory with the same name
   - A `common` test directory is required if there are multiple examples
   - Each test directory must contain a `module_test.go` file and a `README.md` file
   - The tests directory must have a `README.md` file

2. **Framework Usage**
   - All tests must use the Terraform Terratest Framework
   - Test files must import the framework packages
   - The module must have a `go.mod` file with the framework dependency

3. **Test Content**
   - All test files must not be empty
   - Test files must import the terraform-terratest-framework
   - Tests must verify the module's core functionality
   - Common tests must include validation, formatting, and output verification
   - Example-specific tests must verify the unique features of each example

4. **Policy Integration Tests**
   - The repository includes a non-compliant module that fails all policies
   - Integration tests verify that compliant modules pass all policies
   - Integration tests verify that non-compliant modules fail all policies
   - Run with `make rego-integration-test`

### Version and Provider Policies

1. **Terraform Version Constraint**
   - All modules must specify `required_version = ">= 1.12.1"` in `versions.tf`
   - The `versions.tf` file is required in all modules

2. **Provider Restrictions**
   - Only AWS is allowed among major cloud providers (Azure, GCP)
   - Disallowed providers include: `azurerm`, `google`, `google-beta`, `azuread`
   - Other non-cloud providers (GitHub, SumoLogic, etc.) are permitted

## License Policy

1. **Single License**
   - Only the Apache 2.0 license at the repository root is allowed
   - No additional LICENSE files may be added anywhere in the repository
   - No license statements may be added to any files

## Makefile Policy

1. **Standard Makefile**
   - The Makefile must match the content of the skeleton Makefile
   - No modifications to the Makefile are allowed

## Repository Principles

This monorepo enforces the following principles for all modules and services:

- **Self-Contained Repository Deployment Principle:** Every module must be self-contained, including all code, tests, and pipeline logic needed for deployment and validation. See [Self-Contained Repository Deployment Principle](./principles/self-contained-repository-deployment-principle.md).
- **Single Purpose Repository Principle:** Each module must focus on a single responsibility, producing a single, environment-agnostic artifact or service. See [Single Purpose Repository Principle](./principles/single-purpose-repository-principle.md).

## Module Types

- **Primitive Module:**
  - Manages a single major resource type from a provider (e.g., S3, ECS, EC2). Resource blocks are permitted. Must be agnostic, use official providers, and follow the latest skeleton and repo policies. Primitive modules are the most complex and where most raw development occurs. They require the highest level of expertise and scrutiny, as mistakes here can introduce security or compliance risks.

- **Collection Module:**
  - A composition of primitive modules and/or other collection modules. Collection modules can only import other modules (OPA enforced) and cannot contain resource blocks. They are less complex than primitives, and are designed to provide specialized, opinionated sets of resources for use cases (e.g., EKS cluster with SumoLogic integration). Collections are safer for less experienced consumers, as they cannot introduce new resource blocks or bypass security controls.

- **Reference Module:**
  - Provides a fully baked, production-ready service that is secure, observable, follows best practices, and modern architecture patterns. Reference modules are less complex than primitives, and are intended as the main entry point for most consumers. They offer a high degree of confidence, as they are fully tested for security, policy, governance, linting, formatting, and functional testing. Most users will consume reference or collection modules, not primitives.

- **Utility Module:**
  - Adds opinionated functionality (e.g., naming/tagging) or provides data-only structures (such as resource naming constraints for every AWS resource). No resource blocks. Must be agnostic and live in this monorepo.

- **Client Wrapper Module:**
  - Client-specific wrapper that imports reference modules and adds custom logic. Must live in the clientâ€™s repo and follow the same structure/testing standards.

> **Note:** This module organization schema is intentionally layered by complexity. Most consumers should use reference or collection modules, which are less complex and safer by design. The everything-as-a-module approach ensures that consumers can import modules that have already passed all security, policy, governance, linting, formatting, and functional testing, without needing to understand or modify the underlying complexity.

## Provider Strategy

- Always use the latest stable official provider.
- If a required feature/bugfix is missing, fork the provider, follow best practices for forking, and upstream changes when possible. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the provider forking workflow.

## Terragrunt Usage

Terragrunt may be used in downstream consumer repositories for orchestration, but all Terraform logic must reside in this monorepo. Terragrunt HCL should only be used for orchestration, not for defining resource logic.
